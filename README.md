# Hi, I'm Evan 👋🏻

I am a Full-Stack Development Consultant at [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en.html). I have a high value for learning and offering valuable contribution as a team member. I specialize in TypeScript, React, and Node.js. With a background in Electrical Engineering, I offer a unique attention to detail and creativity in problem solving.

I had the privilege of appearing as a guest on [The React Show](https://podcast.thereactshow.com/1764837/12142504) podcast!

I am a fan of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). I am interested in programming languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Go](https://go.dev).

Other than coding, I enjoy fitness, traveling, outdoor activities, and spending time with family and friends.
